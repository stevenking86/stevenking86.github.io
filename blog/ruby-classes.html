  <h1>Welcome to Guitar Class</h1>
  <h2>Using ruby to model a guitar</h2>

  <main>
    <p>
      We've learned a lot about ruby over the past few weeks. A couple weeks ago I did a blog post on arrays and hashes which are great ways to store data. They're container objects that can do a large number of things. But they're not powerful enough tools to emulate a real world object. For that, a class is a better option.
    </p>
    <p>
      A class is in some ways like a guitar store. A class helps create objects. Like going to the guitar store and buying a guitar, a class initializes a new object. A class can also create or manipulate the properties of that object, much like you could go to the guitar store and get a different paint job or get new strings or any number of accessories for the guitar. I'll create a ruby class to model a guitar to better explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I'll create a class called Guitar. I'll also define an initialize method. This will be used to create an instance of a
      guitar. It'll represent what happens when we buy a guitar.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
class Guitar
  def initialize(type, color)
    @type = type
    @color = color
  end
end
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Now I have the ability to create a new instance of Guitar. In order to create it I'll need to give it a type and a color. Here's how I would do that:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
my_guitar = Guitar.new("Gibson SG", "red")
=> #< Context::Guitar:0x000000014d60b0 @type="Gbison SG", @color="red">
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Alright, I have a new guitar. But my class doesn't do much else yet. Let's give it another method and call it.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
class Guitar
  def initialize(type, color)
    @type = type
    @color = color
  end

  def what_kind
    puts "I've got a #{@color} #{@type} and I'm ready to rock."
  end
end

my_guitar=Guitar.new("Gibson SG","red")
=> #< Context::Guitar:0x00000000e26c60 @type="Gibson SG", @color="red">
my_guitar.what_kind
I've got a red Gibson SG and I'm ready to rock.
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Alright, now I've got a method that can tell me what kind of guitar I've got. It happens to also say I'm ready to rock. There's a few things going on here. Notice when I initialized the method, I created a new kind of variable called an instance variable. You can spot them because they start with an @ symbol.  These are great because it means I can use them on any instance of the class that I create. So "my_guitar" will have the instance variable @color "red" and I'm able to call it in my new method what_kind. Very handy. That's nice, but let's do something that could make this class more useful. Perhaps something that reminds the guitar player to change strings after a few gigs.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
class Guitar
  def initialize(type, color)
    @type = type
    @color = color
    @string_use = 0
  end
def play_gig
    if @string_use == 2
      puts "You should definitely change your strings
      before you play another gig!"
      @string_use = 0
    else
      puts"Great gig! You totally rocked."
      @string_use += 1
    end
  end
end

my_guitar=Guitar.new("Gibson SG","red")
..
=> #< Context::Guitar:0x00000002267148 @type="Gibson SG", @color="red", @string_use=0>
   my_guitar.play_gig
Great gig! You totally rocked.
=> 1
   my_guitar.play_gig
Great gig! You totally rocked.
=> 2
   my_guitar.play_gig
You should definitely change your strings
      before you play another gig!
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      So there I added another instance variable of @string_use that gets created when any new instance of guitar gets created. As more gigs are played, the @string_use counter goes up. It makes sure that strings get changed every 3 gigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this was a helpful introduction to classes, class methods, and instance variables!
