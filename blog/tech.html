      I've chosen to research regular expressions today because I'm sick of seeeing it written out and not knowing how to use it! It seems like such a useful tool for scanning a document. Let's jump right in.
    </p>
    <p>A regular expression, or a regex, is a special search pattern. It's a way to scan a document for a letter, a string, or tons of other things. Today I'll be showing examples of how to use regex in ruby but they work in many many places (even in this sublime text editor by pressing ctrl+f and then selecting regular expression!)
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll start with a simple way to replace a word with a different word. I'll be using .sub along with a regex.
    </p>
<pre><code>
line1= "I have a cat."
=> "I have a cat."
line2 = line1.sub(/cat/, "dog")
=> "I have a dog."
</code></pre>
    <p>
      That worked like a charm. But regexes can do much more than search for one word and replace it. Next I'll search for a couple of words that are just a letter apart using square brackets.  I'll use .scan. I'll return my results in an array.
    </p>
<pre><code>
sentence="My cat has a cot."
=>"My cat has a cot."
either=sentence.scan(/c[ao]t/)
=>["cat", "cot"]
</code></pre>
    <p>
      You'll notice a couple things. Putting the letters in a bracket like that is something like an 'or' statement just for that one spot in the word. Also, the syntax for these is to generally use two slashes. That's not always the case. Here I'll use a different method. I'll also be using gsub instead of sub which will catch several instances of a matching regex.
    </p>
<pre><code>
repeated = "I love cars cars cars cars"
=> "I love cars cars cars cars"
repeated.gsub!("cars", "trains")
=> "I love trains trains trains trains"
</code></pre>
    <p>
      A lot of the magic of regexes though, is that they do a lot more than match letters. Here I'll use a regex that searches for whitespace, \s, and replace the white space with a dash.
    </p>
<pre><code>
hero="He man"
=>"He man"
hero.sub!(/\s/, "-")
=>"He-man"
</code></pre>
    <p>
      That's just scratching the surface. There are many many more things that regular expressions can be used for. Good luck out there.
    </p>
