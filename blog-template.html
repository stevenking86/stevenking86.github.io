  I really enjoyed doing this project with a pair. As I was reading through it beforehand I thought that it would be a tough one to pair on. It seemed like a lot of individual work, but Jim and I found a nice balance.

  I found wireframing to be very helpful. I think without it, we would've been coding in the dark a little bit. I literally pulled up the image of the wireframe as I was typing out the HTML.

  We based our wireframe on a simple blog model that I'd found online before we paired together. I asked Jim if he liked the idea of using that as an outline and he agreed. We were really focused on simplicity.

  We used the semantic elements "main" and "footer" on this project. We probably could've used more. I understand how they make HTML easier to read and I definitely wish I would've used them on previous challenges!
