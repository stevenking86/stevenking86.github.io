      I learned HTML back when I was very young, maybe 10 or 11 years old. I made some clunky websites about video games, full of absurd colors and animated gifs. I'm happy to say my web skills have improved during phase 0! But there's still so much more to learn.

      I've enjoyed building my website from scratch. Tackling HTML and CSS has been somewhat challenging for me, much more than I thought it would be. The basics of building a website are very simple, but making it look good and be user friendly is so much harder.  I'm really happy I've got my own corner of the web carved out for myself and that I can manipulate it as I see fit.

      The toughest challenges for me have been related to CSS positioning and making the website aesthetically pleasing. I've been complimented on my color scheme by some other Dev Bootcamp students but it still doesn't feel quite right to me. I look at my website and I look at pages that I think look better and I don't quite have the skills to bridge the gap yet.

      I'm looking forward to incorporating JavaScript into my site. I might even do so before you read this blog post! That's what I'm excited about as I move forward. Happy coding!
