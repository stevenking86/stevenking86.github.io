## 3.5 Challenge Reflection

####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned a lot! I learned that all of those things have really relevant uses as I needed each of them for my very simple website. I had a good grasp of what they all were but I'd never used them in a practical way yet. I learned that they are all powerful and useful.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that positioning isn't as hard as I'd previously thought. BUT - I know that I still have a lot of work to do with making my website look good for different sized screens.


####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I think things like font sizes and text colors are the easiest to implement. Messing with my footer was the most difficult thing to implement and it still isn't behaving exactly as I'd like it to. I also realized I haven't got the best eye for color choices! I must've flip flopped on my colors three or four times and I still don't think it's beautiful.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that it's great to have your HTML really well done. It'll help the CSS formatting go much easier. I ended up adding some semantic tags, ids, and classes to my HTML. I learned I've got a lot to learn!
