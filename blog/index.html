    <a href="git.html">Understanding Version Control</a> - 11/11/2015
    <p>When I glanced at the DBC Phase 0 Curriculum outline I was uneasy. I'd messed with HTML before. I'd worked through some online Ruby courses. I don't know a ton, but if coding is a mountain, I at least knew where the HTML trail and the Ruby trail start. With "git" I was aimlessly wandering across the mountain in the dark...<a class="index-info" href="git.html">(click to continue reading)</a>

    <a href="css-concepts.html">Elements From the Inside Out</a> - 11/28/2015
    <p>I was excited to dive into CSS. I thought, I'd be making my websites look professional in no time once I just dove in. Turns out there's an enormous pile of ideas packed into 'CSS' and even small pieces of it can be tricky to understand. Today, I'll try to unravel the mysteries of margin, border, and padding...<a class="index-info" href="css-concepts.html">(click to continue reading)</a>

    <a href = "arrays-hashes.html">Arrays and Hashes</a> - 12/03/2015
    <p>It's week four of DBC and we're back into the world of ruby. I haven't really focused on it for the past few weeks and wow is it easy to forget things! It was nice to do the exercises this week and to review some things that had slipped my mind. One thing that had become fuzzy was the idea of these "container objects"(term taken from The Well Grounded Rubyist book on this topic.) By "container objects" I'm referring specifically to arrays and hashes...<a class="index-info" href="arrays-hashes.html">(click to continue reading)</a>

    <a href = "enumerable-methods.html">Going Cycling</a> - 12/13/2015
    <p>After a quick look at the ruby-docs I didn't understand what the purpose of #cycle was at all. Does this thing just make infinite loops? How is that useful? The answers to those questions are "sort of" and "you'd be surprised!"...<a class="index-info" href="enumerable-methods.html">(click to continue reading)</a>

    <a class="index-info" href="ruby-classes.html">Guitar Class</a> - 12/18/2015
    <p>We've learned a lot about ruby over the past few weeks. A couple weeks ago I did a blog post on arrays and hashes which are great ways to store data. They're container objects that can do a large number of things. But they're not powerful enough tools to emulate a real world object. For that, a class is a better option...<a class="index-info" href="ruby-classes.html">(click to continue reading)</a>
