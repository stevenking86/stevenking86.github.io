  <h1>Understanding Version Control</h1>

      When I glanced at the DBC Phase 0 Curriculum outline I was uneasy.  I'd messed with HTML before. I'd worked through some online Ruby courses. I don't know a ton, but if coding is a mountain, I at least knew where the HTML trail and the Ruby trail start.  With "git" I was aimlessly wandering across the mountain in the dark.

      I'm certainly no expert, but in the last few days I've successfully made my way onto the "git" trail.  And really it's the broader "version control" trail.  And it's not so bad! Version control is basically just a superior version of pushing "save" on a document.  It allows you to save your progress and attach a little note each time you save.  For example, if you were writing a book report, maybe you'd attach a little note like "wrote the 3rd paragraph detailing Arya Stark's transformation". (That's not good syntax for the type of notes you'll write with version control, but it gets the idea across).

      Version control is excellent for a few reasons. It allows for backtracking and reverting back to previous saves if things get messed up in future versions.  It also is handy when working with a team.  It shows them who's working on what and when they're working on it.   
    </p>
    <p>
      "Git" is the tool we're using to handle version control.  It helps by setting up a three phase system: The working directory, the staging area, and the committed area.  The working directory is what it sounds like: It's when you work on things.  Once you've got something you think you're ready to save you can add it to the staging area.  Once you're ready to "commit" to a save, you commit the thing.  Git allows us to move things in and out of the staging area and to keep track of all commits.  
    <p>
      GitHub is the online arm of git. It's ideal for working on group projects.  If, for example, you wanted to work on a project at the same time as someone else on your team, GitHub makes this possible with cloning.  Simply clone the original project to your own computer and get to work.  Then, perhaps you'd want to implement your changes back to the original project on GitHub. This is possible with merging.  GitHub has a nice, easy to understand graphic interface that makes all this (and more) go smoothly. 
    </p>

      There are certainly many parts of git and GitHub I'm still getting my head around, but I feel like I've got a basic understanding of the concepts and am excited to move forward and learn more!
