		    <h4>Why?</h4>
		    <p>I'm building this website because I didn't feel like I had a great grasp on HTML and CSS just through the codeademy course.  I think if I try to apply it in a practical way, I can understand it better. I'm using the Resume part of the codeacademy course as a guide.</p>
		    <h4> Why else?</h4>
		    <p>I wanted to practice some command line tools and sublime shortcuts that I'd learned over the past couple of days.</p>
