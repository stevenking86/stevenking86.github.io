  <h1>Ruby vs. JavaScript:</h1>
  <h2>Battle of the Loops</h2>

      Computers are good at repetitive actions. That's probably taught on day one in many different kinds of computer programming courses. It's taught again on refactoring day. "Don't repeat blocks of code. Have the computer do it for you!" Today I'll look at how to tell the computer to execute repeated blocks of code using loops in both ruby and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>I'm going to make a simple program that outputs numbers zero through five into the terminal. There are multiple ways to do this in each language, of course. I'll start with a ruby example:
    </p>
<pre><code>
i = 0
while i <=5
  puts i
  i += 1
end
</code></pre>
    <p>
    So, to explain: I created a variable, i. Then I set up a looping condition using "while". I puts'd 'i' to the console and then increased i by 1 each time through the loop. Now I'll make a similar program in JavaScript:
    </p>
<pre><code>
var i = 0
while (i <=5){
    console.log(i);
    i ++;
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      They're actually really similar when written that way, other than some obvious syntax differences. This isn't the case for a lot of ways these two languages work so it's a relief to look at them this way. For the sake of learning, I'll look at a couple ways more ways to write this program in each language. I'll start with ruby again.
    </p>
<pre><code>
(0..5).each {|x| puts x}
</pre></code>
    <p>That's a joyfully simple ruby way to do this. It makes me smile. What's happening is I'm using a range, (0..5) and looping using each. For each number in the range, I'm assinging the variable x, then putsing x to the console. Here's one more way to write this program in JavaScript:
    </p>
<pre><code>
for (var x = 0; x <= 5; x ++){
    console.log(x);
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      This is better than the first JavaScript method in some ways, but not as improved as I was able to do with ruby. It's sort of just like transforming the 'while' method into something closer to a single line version.
    </p>
    <p>
      My conclusion is that both languages handle looping logic pretty well. Ruby is elegant and offers many options. JavaScript is a bit more verbose, but it's still easy to read. Happy looping!
